agricultural scenario for thousands of years. India being
a predominantly agrarian economy has about 70 per
cent of its population living in villages, where livestock
play a crucial role in the socio-economic life. Livestock
provide high-quality foods such as milk, cheese, butter,
ghee, etc. India is not only one of the top producers of
milk in the world, but also the largest consumer of milk
and milk products in the world. Due to the shortfall in
supply, we have to import significant amounts of milk
products to meet internal demand. .</p>
